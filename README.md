## ‚ú® Features

This project is built with a modern tech stack and includes a robust set of features for both interviewees and interviewers.

### For the Interviewee:
-   **Automated Interview Flow:** A seamless, multi-step interview process from start to finish.
-   **Resume Parsing:** Automatically extracts candidate details (name, email, phone) from uploaded PDF or DOCX resumes.
-   **AI-Generated Questions:** Receives a series of 6 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard) tailored to the job role specified by the interviewer.
-   **Timed Responses:** Each question has a specific time limit, encouraging concise and focused answers. The interview automatically advances only when the timer runs out.
-   **Persistent Sessions:** If a candidate refreshes or closes the page, they are greeted with a "Welcome Back" modal, allowing them to continue their session without losing progress.

### For the Interviewer:
-   **Secure Dashboard:** The interviewer tab is protected by a password that is required upon every tab switch and page refresh.
-   **Dynamic Role Setting:** Admins can set the specific job role (e.g., "Senior Python Developer") for which the AI should generate questions.
-   **Comprehensive Results:** View a list of all candidates who have completed the interview.
-   **Detailed Analysis:** For each candidate, view:
    -   An AI-generated overall score (0-100).
    -   A concise, AI-written summary of the candidate's performance.
    -   The full interview transcript, including every question and answer.
-   **Search and Sort:** The candidate list can be easily searched by name and sorted by name, score, or status (Hired/Rejected).

    npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer lucide-react sonner react-dropzone
    ```

3.  **Set up shadcn/ui Components:**
    This project uses `shadcn/ui` for its components. After initializing the project, the components are added individually.
    ```
    # Initialize shadcn/ui in the project (only needs to be done once)
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init

    # Add the specific components used in this project
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card input label tabs dialog alert-dialog badge table sonner
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
