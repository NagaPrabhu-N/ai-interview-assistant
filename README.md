# AI Interview Assistant

An intelligent, AI-powered web application designed to automate technical interviews. This tool allows candidates to take timed, role-specific interviews generated by Google's Gemini AI, with per‚Äëinterview storage in Firebase Cloud Firestore for cross‚Äëdevice reviewer access and device‚Äëlocal session persistence for candidates.

## ‚ú® Features

This project is built with a modern tech stack and includes a robust set of features for both interviewees and interviewers.

### For the Interviewee:
-   **Automated Interview Flow:** A seamless, multi-step interview process from start to finish.
-   **Resume Parsing:** Automatically extracts candidate details (name, email, phone) from uploaded PDF or DOCX resumes.
-   **AI-Generated Questions:** Receives a series of 6 questions (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard) tailored to the job role specified by the interviewer.
-   **Timed Responses:** Each question has a specific time limit, encouraging concise and focused answers. The interview automatically advances only when the timer runs out.
-   **Persistent Sessions:** If a candidate refreshes or closes the page, they are greeted with a "Welcome Back" modal, allowing them to continue their session without losing progress.

### For the Interviewer:
-   **Secure Dashboard:** The interviewer tab is protected by a password (`admin`) that is required upon every tab switch and page refresh.
-   **Dynamic Role Setting:** Admins can set the specific job role (e.g., "Senior Python Developer") for which the AI should generate questions.
-   **Cross‚ÄëDevice History:** Each completed interview is saved as a new Firestore document (one‚Äëdocument‚Äëper‚Äëinterview) keyed by candidate name plus timestamp for reliable listing across devices.
-   **Comprehensive Results:** View a list of all candidates who have completed the interview and drill into details backed by Firestore.
-   **Detailed Analysis:** For each candidate, view:
    -   An AI-generated overall score (0-100).
    -   A concise, AI-written summary of the candidate's performance.
    -   The full interview transcript, including every question and answer.
-   **Search and Sort:** The candidate list can be easily searched by name and sorted by name, score, or status (Hired/Rejected).

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_SENDER_ID
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID

    ```

4.  **Set up shadcn/ui (if needed):**
    If you need to add more components, first initialize `shadcn/ui` and then add components individually.
    ```
    # Initialize (only needs to be done once)
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init

    # Example: add a new component
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
